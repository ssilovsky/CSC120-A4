- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Encapsulation was difficult to wrap my head around, especially the technical side of it. I feel like I have a better grasp on it after this assignment, but definitely not a perfect grasp. I highly recommend testing early, and often with your code. I tested my outputs and looked through the step-by-step processes of my code with https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit in order to see how the objects worked through my program. The Train class was particularly difficult for me. I also recommend starting on the assignment early.
